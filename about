Welcome to **Evocation**.

Evocation is a community server, founded in December 2018, that concentrates on the genre of fantasy within speculative fiction. We have a plethora of channels in relevance to subgenres, including high fantasy, low fantasy, dystopian fantasy, and magical realism. Our mission is to establish a community where unity converges with differing perceptions.

If you have received a punishment that was either issued unjustifiably or there were fallacies in evidence that lead to punitive action, you may request to have them removed from your record: <https://bit.ly/2G2uChT>.

:enter: __**HEXYTE**__

<@747105315840983212> is a bot that allows users to communicate with staff securely. Please note that Hexyte is intended to be a substitution of users Direct Messaging staff for help; we would appreciate you utilising this medium, rather than approaching specific staff members. All communications per this method may be recorded. You are advised only to use Hexyte if you have a concern of legitimacy; misuse may result in punishment.

:enter: __**STAFF**__

Evocation's staff members endorse the supposition that they are to upkeep and enforce the server's regulations, hence their prior familiarisation. They volunteer to pursue the duties of their roles and their contributions are solely out of their own interest. 

The server is currently owned and was founded by <@369497100834308106>.

**<@&528574377722249216>** **`➜`** Server administrators comprise executive staff members whose commitments to the server are of substantial nature. Administration staff usually complete assignments that are behind the scenes. They have permissions that are incomparable to that of moderation staff, though their abilities are only to be used where they are of necessity.

**<@&528619896762794004>** **`➜`** These are your friendly server moderators who actively help out within the community and are here to answer questions on a regular basis. They possess various empowering abilities and are the reason why the server is not in absolute chaos all the time. They have sound judgement and recognition of pre-existing biases when deciding upon verdicts. They are able to sympathise and recognise all sides of an argument.

If you are in doubt of a moderator's judgement, you are able to express your concerns to Evocation's administration team, which may result in punitive actions being reversed, should sufficient evidencing/reasoning be provided. Please Direct Message <@747105315840983212> to initiate the process. The thread will only be visible to server administrators.

:enter: __**EXPERIENCE SYSTEM & ROLE REWARDS**__

Each time you send a message, you will receive a random amount of experience between two predefined values. You can only gain experience once per minute. Upon meeting certain level thresholds, you will receive a role advancement.

Gaining **LEVEL 3** will award you with **<@&529629703460618240>**, which will give you access to change your own nickname, embed links, attach files, add reactions and stream into the server.

__**ROLE REWARDS**__

**<@&531105327714926629>** **`➜`** **LEVEL 60**

**<@&529629703460618240>** **`➜`** **LEVEL 3**
