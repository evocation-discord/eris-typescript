Eris is built to run on any kind of environment or operating system.

### Rules
> Before you get started, **please read the following rules**.
1. **NEVER** share the bot token, your password, repository contents or the repository link with others.
2. Make sure to create a new branch while working on a new feature. This is due to the fact that we'd like to review the code before it gets released.
3. Make sure you've read all of the above and the contents in [#non-disclosure-agreement]() in the development server.
