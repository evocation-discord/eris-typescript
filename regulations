**1**. Follow Discord's Terms of Service (<https://discord.com/terms>) and Community Guidelines (<https://discord.com/guidelines>).

**2**. Display respect to all users and their opinions, regardless of hierarchical position, and exercise common sense indiscriminately.

**3**. All forms of spam are strictly prohibited.

**4**. Any discussion or mention of suicide or self-harm is disallowed.

**5**. Distribution of potentially malicious items is impermissible. This is inclusive of websites, pirated software, cracks, shortened links, executable files and anything that moderation staff determine is a violation.

**6**. Discussion centred on sexually explicit content is **allowed**, but there are still certain topics that all members are expected to avoid, including - but not limited to - rape, bestiality, sexual assault and molestation. You are not permitted to link to external sites which host inappropriate/adult-themed content. Any inappropriate files (images, videos, etc.) are illicit. There is a point at which extremity is defined, which is dependent upon moderator discretion. Please note that usernames, nicknames, profile pictures and custom statuses must be appropriate. 

**7**. We are primarily an English-speaking community. Any non-English languages should be spoken in #international, with exclusivity.

**8**. Respect channel topics and rules. Always check pinned messages before proceeding.

**9**. Discussing disciplinary action in public is not permitted and will only result in escalation of punishment, per the discretion of the handling moderation team member.

**10**. Assumption of moderation responsibilities is not authorised. If you are not a moderator, you have no right to tell users what they can and cannot do, or how to behave. If you encounter a user that is breaking the server's regulations, you may mention an online staff member. For emergencies, you are allowed to mention the **<@&528619896762794004>** role. Abuse of this privilege will result in punishment.

**11**. Rules are not exhaustive. Moderation team members are permitted to punish users for whatever they determine to be discourteous or violative. Do not attempt to find any loopholes in regulations.

**12**. Alternative accounts are strictly prohibited. Upon discovery, offending accounts will be removed from the server (kicked). If you decide to re-join, we will permanently ban your alternative account, meaning your IP address will be banned.
